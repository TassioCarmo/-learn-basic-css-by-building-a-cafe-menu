# Basic concepts of CSS Designing a menu page for a cafe webpage.
## what did i learn

The <code>title</code> is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.

For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.

<code>< meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /></code>

You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:
<code><
selector1, selector2 {
  property: value;
}
</code>
